                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p><strong>Andrés Calamaro</strong> (Andrés Calamaro Massel, August 22, 1961), is an Argentine musician, composer and Latin Grammy winner. His former band Los Rodríguez was a major success in Spain in the 1990s. He is multi-instrumentalist and he became one of the main icons of Argentine rock and has sold over 1.3 million copies.</p>

                <h2>Life and career</h2>

    <h3>Abuelos de la Nada</h3>
    <p>Andres Calamaro was born in Buenos Aires. At 17 years of age he participated as a guest in the recording of an album of the group Raíces, and shortly after he started his own band, the Elmer Band, with guitarist friend Gringui Herrera. This band had an underground hit, Tristeza de la Ciudad (City Blues).</p>

<p>When Miguel Abuelo, leader of Los Abuelos de la Nada, returned to Argentina, he reunited the band and invited Calamaro to play keyboards. The band was a big success; Calamaro wrote some of their greatest hits, such as Sin gamulán, Mil horas and Costumbres argentinas.</p>

<h3>First Solo Period</h3>
<p>Before the dissolution of Los Abuelos de la Nada, Calamaro released his first solo album, Hotel Calamaro in 1984. A second album, Vida Cruel, recorded shortly after his separation from the band, was received warmly by the press but did not achieve commercial success.</p>
    <p>After a third album, Por Mirarte (1988), Calamaro started producing for bands such as Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Enanitos Verdes and soloists such as Fabiana Cantilo.</p>
<p>Calamaro closed the 1980s with his own band, featuring old friends Gringui Herrera and Ariel Rot, who recently came back from Spain. The trio recorded the album Nadie sale vivo de aquí (No One Gets Out of Here Alive) in 1989 with a number of guest musicians, which obtained the nomination of Best Record of the Year.</p>

<h3>Los Rodríguez</h3>
<p>
    Due to the economic situation in Argentina, Calamaro and Rot settled in Spain, where they created the band Los Rodríguez with Julián Infante and Germán Villela on drums. The band didn't have a bass player, but Guillermo Martin, Candi Avello, and later Daniel Zamora accompanied the band in recordings and tours.</p>
    
   <p> Los Rodríguez released three successful studio albums: Buena Suerte (1991), Sin documentos (1993) and Palabras más, palabras menos (1995), as well as the live Disco Pirata (1992), and the compilation Hasta luego (1996).</p>
    
    <p>Sin documentos gave them international acclaim, with its mixture of Rock, Flamenco and Latin American rhythms. They toured Spain and Latin America, and entered the history of Rock in Spanish.</p>
